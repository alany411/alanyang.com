After interviewing several entry-level developers, it became clear that many struggle without AI assistance. Some common issues I observed included:

- Difficulty explaining their thought process when evaluating problems
- Weak understanding of programming fundamentals and debugging
- Ineffective at searching for answers in documentation or online resources

## AI: Tool or Crutch?

AI-powered coding tools have never been more accessible. They offer features like code completion, refactoring, and generation. While these tools are powerful, many new developers misuse them, turning them into crutches. Instead of understanding and validating AI-generated code, they simply use it without question.

## The Decline of Debugging and Problem-Solving Skills

Problem-solving is a core skill for every developer. Debugging and analyzing issues are essential for growth. However, many new developers skip these steps and instead rely on AI-generated solutions. This weakens their troubleshooting skills and logical thinking over time.

## Using AI the Right Way

New developers should strive to solve problems. AI is not going away, but it should be used responsibly.

- **AI should complement problem-solving, not replace it.** Try solving problems before turning to AI.
- **Analyze AI-generated code.** Understand and validate the logic behind suggestions.
- **Do not blindly trust AI.** Read documentation and other resources to validate suggestions.

## AI is an Amplifier

AI does not make a bad developer good, it actually amplifies existing skill levels. Strong developers use AI to enhance their learning and productivity, while weaker developers become increasingly dependent, widening the skill gap. The key is to use AI as a tool for growth rather than a substitute for fundamental skills.
