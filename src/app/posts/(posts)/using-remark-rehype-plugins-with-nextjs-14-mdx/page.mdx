I have been redesigning and redeveloping my personal website for a couple of weeks now. Before when I was using the Pages Router, I used [contentlayer](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer) with Remark and Rehype plugins to transform my MDX content. Since I was basically redoing my entire website and [contentlayer is kind of no longer maintained](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer/issues/429), I thought it would be a good time to try [@next/mdx](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/mdx#nextmdx) instead.

## What Are Remark and Rehype Plugins?

[Remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) and [Rehype](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype) are tools used to transform markdown and HTML content respectively with plugins. Since React does not natively support markdown, the markdown content needs to be transformed into HTML before it can be rendered. This is where Remark and Rehype come in.

## Get Remark and Rehype Plugins Working With Next.js 14

After getting most of my setup done, I had to some time trying to figure out why the plugins were not working. I ended up finding the solution from a comment on a [StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/75571708) and [Next.js GitHub issue](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/46659#issuecomment-1542183041).

I was using an experimental feature that I _probably_ should not have been using. When using Remark or Rehype plugins with Next.js, you have to make sure that the experimental feature `mdxRs` is either not defined or explicitly set to `false` in your `next.config.mjs`.

Besides this one hiccup that I had, the usage of Remark and Rehype plugins was pretty straightforward. You would just install and import the plugins into your `next.config.mjs` and then include them in your MDX options.

```js title="next.config.mjs" showlinenumbers="true"
import createMDX from '@next/mdx'

// Imported plugins
import rehypePrismPlus from 'rehype-prism-plus'
import remarkGfm from 'remark-gfm'

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  experimental: { mdxRs: false }, // Do not use experimental mdxRs feature
  pageExtensions: ['mdx', 'ts', 'tsx'],
  reactStrictMode: true,
}

const withMDX = createMDX({
  options: {
    remarkPlugins: [remarkGfm], // Remark plugins
    rehypePlugins: [rehypePrismPlus], // Rehype plugins
  },
})

export default withMDX(nextConfig)
```
