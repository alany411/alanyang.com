## My Role

**Lead Developer**. I spearheaded the frontend development of the widget from inception to completion. This involved architecting the overall structure, detailing its implementation, and developing the widget in close collaboration with UX/UI designers, backend engineers, and QA analysts to ensure a seamless, responsive, and accessible experience that met the needs of both stakeholders and end users.

## Key Features

- **Easily Embeddable** - Quickly integrates into any approved website by adding a simple script tag.
- **Responsive** - Designed to be used on any device.
- **Accessible** - Compatible with screen readers and keyboard navigation.
- **Session Persistence** - Retains session context so users can navigate between pages and keep the same conversation going.
