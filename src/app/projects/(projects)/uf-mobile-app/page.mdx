## Overview

The University of Florida's original mobile app was a vendor-provided solution that consistently fell short of both our internal goals and user expectations. To address these issues, our team built a proof of concept and proposal to demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of bringing development in-house. This initiative ultimately led to a successful transition away from the vendor and the launch of a fully in-house mobile app.
